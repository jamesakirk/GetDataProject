Columns in data:

subject: an integer (1-30) uniquely identifying the human subject from whom the data was collected  

activity: a string identifying the activity in which the subject was engaged during data collection, can be:  
WALKING  
WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
SITTING  
STANDING  
LAYING  

The following columns are included and represent the means of the "means and standard deviations" assosiated with each "activity-subject" pair. Further description the the physical mean and processing of the data can be found in the README of the HAR dataset:
